Eating a chocolate donut and talking all things astronomy as I watched the Mercury transit with over fifty people at the Houge Park, was indeed a great way to start the week...

If you've never heard of a Mercury transit, it's kind of a big deal. The planet Mercury crossed the face of the Sun today - a small dot moving across the day star. This is not happening again until 2032 but then, you can't see that one from the U.S. - the next one here isn't until 2049. To stress the point, Mercury passed closer to the center of the solar disk today than in any other transit of this century.

#### So yeah, this is rare, but why? 
Mercury is the fastest planet and if it orbited on the same plane as the Earth, we would see a transit every 166 days. But the orbit of Mercury is inclined and we only see a transit when the orbits cross such that Mercury is directly between the us and the Sun. The transits of Venus are even rarer.

#### Micro-Eclipse
A transit is basically a micro-eclipse. Mercury is about the size of our moon but since it's so far away, it can occlude much less of our Sun and is but a small dot on the disk. The moon, on the other hand, can cover the disk of the Sun and cause a total eclipse. Here's a fun fact: Our moon is moving away from us too and consequently, there will come a time when it can no longer occlude the Sun's disk the way it does now. And we won't have total solar eclipses thereafter.

#### We're tiny!
We are not pretending anything else, but seeing Mercury like this puts the scale of our Sun in perspective. Again, Mercury is about the size of our moon.

#### Finding Exoplanets
Around the time when I was born, we did not know of any planets orbiting other stars. Today, we know hundreds of exoplanets. Transits are very relevant to the way exoplanets are found and studied. Observers look for a dip in the brightness of a star, that occurs when a planet transits across its face - just like Mercury today.

Speaking of transits and dimming of a star's brightness, I'll briefly mention Algol, the 'Demon Star'. It is actually two stars orbiting each other and from our perspective, the smaller star regularly passes in front of the larger brighter one, causing eclipses about every 2 days 20 hours.

#### SJAA
We hosted an observing session at the Houge Park. We had the club's Lunt H-alpha scopes set up, one for visual observing and another for live video. We also had a Lunt white light scope for visual observing. In addition to this, a lot of club members and the public showed up with a good mix of scopes and projection set-ups. Some amazing friends also got donuts, bagels and beverages!

Eating a chocolate donut and talking all things astronomy as I watched the Mercury transit with over fifty people at the Houge Park, was indeed a great way to start the week - I'm so glad I dragged myself out of bed at 6:30 AM this morning!
