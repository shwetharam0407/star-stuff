On night, I was out with my guest for the month, an Orion StarBlast 113 4.5 inch Newtonian Tabletop reflector and decided to aim for the moon...

[<span style="color:blue">SJAA loaner program</span>](https://www.sjaa.net/programs/loaner-telescope-program/) enabled me to try out a different scope every month. While I'm yet to make up my mind on which one to buy, I've tried a bunch of scopes and learnt a lot about them and met some super awesome people along the way. More recently, I started volunteering for the loaner program, so I could help other people on this journey and learn some more.

On night, I was out with my guest for the month, an [<span style="color:blue">Orion StarBlast</span>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0nkpNnYZHAXZnQ2dFpuSlZnZEk/view) 113 4.5 inch Newtonian Tabletop reflector and decided to aim for the moon. I had my iPhone with me and it had to serve as the camera. I had no adapter mount and aligning the phone lens with the eyepiece by hand and holding it still turned out to be quite challenging. A colleague then recommended [<span style="color:blue">this adapter that works with any phone</span>](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J9F19I8/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_c_api_b1AHBbB04F0KR) and it's been quite useful. A further challenge was to get the focus setting right. All in all, I spent a lot of time and took way too many bad pictures. But a few of them turned out to be decent.
