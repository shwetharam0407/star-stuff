As I counted down with an amazing crowd, we reached totality and I experienced two minutes of darkness in the middle of the day...

The trip to Oregon to see the 2017 total solar eclipse was undoubtably one of the most fun road trips I've ever been on. I went with a dozen amazing people from work. We rented two RVs and drove to Madras, the scene of the totality. With a bunch of gear - some personal and some stolen from our labs, we were all set to capture the eclipse. Needless to say, we had our-optics-engineer-certified protective eye glasses.

Turned out, a *lot* of people had the same idea. The place was extremely crowded and I remember we paid $200 to park an RV in an empty field. Below is a picture of one of the campgrounds.

The crowd certainly added to the experience - it was a lot of fun to witness the eclipse with so many people. On the other hand, the crowd also caused a massive traffic jam and it took us over 20 hours to drive back to the Bay Area. I remember getting out of the RV and walking along the freeway for a while before hopping back in - that's how slow we were going!

We reached our campground the night before and spent a good amount of time chatting and stargazing over food and drinks. When I woke up in the morning, the Sun was already up. We set up our gear, made coffee and with growing impatience, waited for the show to start.

The partial phase started around 9 AM. We had a lot of time to play with our cameras and take some fun pictures. Below is one I find particularly amuzing. A friend was recording the eclipse with his phone hooked up to his scope. My idea was to take a picture of the phone screen. When I saw a reflection of my face in the picture, I said something along the lines of "Damn, no polarizer on my phone camera". But someone looked at this picture and said, "That's a cool selfie!" and soon, a bunch of us were posing for this "eclipse selfie". I put mine up on Instagram and a lot of people have complimented me on it. Funny what trends catch on!

Around 10:15 AM, there was a buzz of excitement around. The moon got closer and closer to covering our favorite day star. As I counted down with an amazing crowd, we reached totality and I experienced two minutes of darkness in the middle of the day. I even saw a few stars. I got to see the corona - the outermost layer of the Sun visible by sight from Earth only during a total solar eclipse.

Two minutes later, the moon started receding and it was light again. We took another shot at some pictures we didn't get quite right the first time. And then, when it was over, we packed up and started the *loong* drive back home.

I had just started driving in the U.S.A and hence, I passed on driving the RVs - I wish I hadn't, to this day!
